        <p>
            I started programming in middle school, and funny enough it was HTML. Ever since then I've been interested
            in pursuing knowledge in coding. I knew that if my future didn't involve computers, I'd hate the job. So currently
            I'm studying Software Engineering at CodeCrew, striving for success and knowledge.
            I am learning HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Javascript currently. I'm excited to learn more and don't hesitate to reach out!
