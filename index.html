                            <h3>Hello, my name is Conner Thompson, I'm 20 years old and a student Software Engineer at CodeCrew. </h3>
                            
                            <img src="/selfie.jpeg" alt="Me!"/>

                            <p>I started programming in middle school, and funny enough it was HTML. Ever since then I've been interested
                                in pursuing knowledge in coding. I knew that if my future didn't involve computers, I'd hate the job. So currently
                                I'm studying Software Engineering at CodeCrew, striving for success and knowledge.
                                I am learning HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Javascript currently. I'm excited to learn more and don't hesitate to reach out!
